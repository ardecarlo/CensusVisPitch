## What Is CensusVis?

1. A tool for exploring US Census demographic data
 - Shows state and national maps
 - Shows race data as raw numbers as well as percent of county population
 - Shows data in tabular form as well as map form
2. CensusVis is a quick, easy, exploratory data analysis tool for US census data

## Why CensusVis?
 - Because percentage of a county's population does not always relate to population total or even population density.
 - CensusVis not only shows who lives where, but how many people live there
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(maps)
library(mapproj)
source("helpers.R")

shades <- colorRampPalette(c("white", "darkgreen"))(100)
counties <- readRDS("data/counties.rds")
counties$state <- unlist(lapply (counties$name,
                                 function (x) strsplit(x,',')[[1]][1]))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
percent_map(counties$white, "darkgreen", "White")
count_map(log10(counties$white * counties$total.pop / 100), "darkgreen", "White")

```
