## What Is CensusVis?

1. A tool for exploring US Census demographic data
 - Shows state and national maps
 - Shows race data as raw numbers as well as percent of county population
 - Shows data in tabular form as well as map form
2. CensusVis is a quick, easy, exploratory data analysis tool for US census data

## Why CensusVis?
 - Because percentage of a county's population does not always relate to population total or even population density.
 - CensusVis not only shows who lives where, but how many people live there
